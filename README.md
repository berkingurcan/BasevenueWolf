# BasevenueWolf

`ETH Global Agentic 2025`

üöÄ BasevenueWolf is the blockchain and AI-powered alternative to [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/), bringing seamless, transparent, and trustless product management and revenue analytics to Web3 Applications.

Project is deployed on Base Sepolia Testnet: [https://basevenuewolf.web.app](https://basevenuewolf.web.app/)

### Problems We Solve

Web2 Game developers would like to migrate to Web3 (NFTs, tokens, in-game items, subscriptions, etc.), but handling the migration is complex, expensive and challenging.

1. Development ‚Äì Web2 developers often lack experience with smart contracts, blockchain SDKs, and decentralized architectures, making it difficult to transition smoothly .

2. Tokeneconomics - Designing sustainable token models, ensuring liquidity, and managing inflationary/deflationary mechanisms require expertise in blockchain economics.

3. Payment Integrations - Enabling seamless crypto and fiat payment options for game users, integrating wallets, and ensuring regulatory compliance can be challenging. (TODO: We will solve this problem with our Paywall Integration feature).

npm run dev
```

### Prettier

```bash
npm run format
```

## Smart Contracts

BasevenueWolf uses several smart contracts to manage game items, products, and currencies. Here's an overview of the main contracts:

### CustomERC20
A standard ERC20 token implementation that can be used for creating custom game currencies or tokens.
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20
- Allows setting custom name, symbol, and initial supply
- Initial supply is minted to a specified owner address

### GameProduct
A specialized ERC20 token designed specifically for game products and in-game currencies.
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20
- Similar to CustomERC20 but specifically branded for game products
- Configurable name, symbol, and initial supply
- Initial supply is minted to the game owner's address

### GameItem (ERC721)
An NFT implementation for unique game items and collectibles.
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721URIStorage
- Supports metadata through tokenURI
- Features:
  - Custom base URI for metadata
  - Sequential token ID generation
  - Minting function with optional metadata URI
  - Full ERC721 standard compliance

Each contract comes with its corresponding deployer contract (ERC20Deployer, GameProductDeployer, GameItemDeployer) that facilitates easy deployment and management of new token instances.

## Contract Deployment

### Installation
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### Deployment Scripts
The project includes three main deployment scripts:

1. **deploy.ts** - Deploys the ERC20Deployer contract and a sample token
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network custom
```

2. **deploy-game-product.ts** - Deploys the GameProductDeployer and a sample game product
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-game-product.ts --network custom
```

3. **deploy-game-item.ts** - Deploys the GameItemDeployer and a sample NFT collection
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-game-item.ts --network custom
```

After deployment, the script will output the addresses of the deployed contracts. Make sure to save these addresses for future reference.
